## Travel Journal

Very simple travel journal exercise from the [freeCodeCamp ReactJS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&list=PL3mY6d1fMqmIN7e8w-_p_F9qwjqvYBbFd&index=2&t=16771s).

To get it running:
* Make sure you have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en);
* Open your command line interface of choice and `cd` to the root folder of the repository (the one that contains the README.md file);
* Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies;
* After installing the dependencies, run `npm start`.
